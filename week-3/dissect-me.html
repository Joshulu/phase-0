            Well we'll start off with our questions today for readability
            I'll re-type the question for each paragraph.
         </p>
         <p>
            What are the benefits of version control?
            How does git help you keep track of changes?
            Why use GitHub to store your code?

        <h4>
          What are the benefits of VCS(Version Control System)?
        </h4>
        <p>
            Well there are several, but I think the best things to think
            about are accessability, continuity, and collaboration.
         </p>
         <p> 
            Accessability: The point of using a VCS is to be able to manage
            a project.  For programmers, this means there are a lot of files
            in a lot of places.  If you have a partner (which you almost
            always will) that creates two seperate workflows and directory
            flows unless you both syncronize via a VCS.  You could both use
            a single access point without figuring out who has what and where.
         </p> 
         <p> 
            Continuity: This where it gets good.  Using VCS you can have several
            all work within that one directory and not save over each other's work.
            Using code commands you could grab the most recent change and work from
            the new starting point.  It also means saving multiple versions of the
            same files to work without fear of irreversably damaging your code.
            Before you submit your code to the original, it can also be reviewed to
            make sure it is indeed ready for a final product.  From step one to step
            done, everyone can work on seperate parts without overlapping; working
            worry free.
         </p>
         <p>
           Collaboration:  This one is short and simple.  Using all the tools available,
           you can have a team of One Hundred work on seperate parts of a project
           simultaneously.  Because of its accessability and continuity, creating with
           a team becomes vastly easier a task than without a VCS.

       <h4>
          How does git help you keep track of changes?
       </h4>
       <p>
          To be honest, this one is short.
       </p>
       <p> 
          There are several git commands you use to keep track of changes.  There are more but I will list some here:
       </p> 
       <ul> 
          <li>git log      -generates a list of all changes made, when they were made, and who made them</li>
          <li>git status   -generates a prompt of what branch you're on, whether it's up to date with its parent branch, tracked files, and untracked files</li>
          <li>git push     -can be used to 'push' your files to the internet VCS</li>
          <li>git pull     -can be used to 'pull' recent changes in the project to your computer</li>
          <li>git add      -used to add untracked files to 'tracked files'</li>
          <li>git commit   -used to add 'tracked files' to staging area before a 'push'</li>
       </ul>
       </section>
      <section>
       <h4>
          Why use GitHub to store your code?
       </h4>
       <p>
         Short again:  I think the main reason that I like GitHub is that its
         system of push pull and fork(creating a copy of someone else's project)
         is automated to constantly notify GitHub.  GitHub has a record of everything
         anyone has done to your code.  That makes me feel secure with putting it
         up on the internet.
       </p>
       <p>
         I think that's all for now, I may update when I learn more about GitHub
         and can give more reasons as to why it should be used, but for now I need
         more experience!
