•Paste a link to your [USERNAME].github.io repository.

•Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.

  At the top right of the screen, next to your profile icon, should be a plus sign.  Click the sign and click the option to create a new repository.  Once you've finished creating the repository, there will be a link under a menu that says "Https clone."  Then copy it into the terminal as, git clone paste-link-here
  
•Describe what open source means.

  Open source means a lot of things getting into the various licenses, but, in general, it means that anyone has access to and rights to modify or use the code you've open sourced.
  
•What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?

  I think a lot of things about it.  It's a great tool for sure, but it's nerve wracking wondering if there's just that one person out there who could attempt to use it themselves.  Who can you trust especially on a large project.  Places like github however, seem to have good security features in place for things like that and most worries are just  anxieties building over a false concept.  I tread lightly, but once I can see and use it more, I'm sure it will be invaluable.
  
•Assess the importance of using licenses.

Licenses create restrictions or the lack there-of for projects released to the public.  It protects the creator and their ideas from any above mentioned ne'erdowells.

•What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?

  Resolidified branching and merging back, which I had some trouble with remembering from where to pull or push.   Otherwise, once I got that, it was easy moving again.
  
•Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

  I didn't see the need to look elsewhere for resources just yet.
