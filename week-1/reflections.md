# 1.1 Think About Time

Among the list of ideas, I spent extra time on the Fogg Method, Charles Duhigg's method, and meditation, specifically open-monitoring meditation and focused meditation.

Time Boxing is the practice of creating a deadline and working until time is up.  The focus is not on completion of the project but rather on quantifying how much you could complete within the time frame.  It is useful for measuring how long it takes to do a specific task.  If done repeatedly, one could measure their productivity cycle or working/learning habits.  In Phase 0, I could use it to make accurate approximations on what the difference is in a short or medium challenge or as a way to test myself within a challenge by looking at all I accomplished within specific time frames.

My current time management practice consists of procrastination mostly.  I am loathe to do something I find disinteresting which I end up handling 3:2 procrastination versus getting it done and over as soon as possible.  I always prefer getting it done as it leaves the rest of my day open, but it's something I'm working on still.

I use to meditate so I think I can get back into it if I try.  I really enjoy the idea behind Duhigg's method of starting with a "chocolate" to get my work/workout/chores done until I feel good just for doing what I should be doing.  The Fogg method seems equally as simple, at least on paper.  I think I'll start with meditation and attempt Duhigg's method for now.

As far as my plan goes, I plan to take it as it comes.  Read through the challenges and assignments before starting them.  Reading it first will give me an inkling to think about as I go back and start a challenge.  Once I start, it's just a matter of checking my time vs productivity and constantly working on ways to improve efficiency by experimenting with how I spend my work time and break time.

 This project took me about 2 hours to complete although I took several breaks throughout.

# 1.4 Forking and Cloning

If "I" were to write instructions on how to create a new repo, fork a repo, and clone a repo, it would be to create a GitHub account and follow their bootcamp on how to (that's what was shown on my start page after logging in).  However, to make a personal tutorial, my instructions would be pretty much the same as this challenge.  To create a new one, click the '+' icon at the top right of your profile.  To fork a repo, go to the repo you want to fork, and click the 'fork' button.  To clone a repo, copy and paste the HTTPS link on the repo page and in your terminal paste "git clone paste-link-here"

 

For this challenge there weren't any problems I encountered.  I didn't learn anything extra outside of how to create, clone, and fork a repository.

This challenge took about 20 minutes to complete
