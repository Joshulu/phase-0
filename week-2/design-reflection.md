What are the 6 Phases of Web Design?

1. Information Gathering
2. Planning
3. Design
4. Development
5. Testing and Delivery
6. Maintenance

(They group nicely together in pairs (1,2), (3,4), and (5,6).

(1) Information gathering is a very general term, but that's kind of
the point. In general I personally think if you can answer some
basic questions (who, what, why, when, and how) then you
have a pretty good chance at doing this successfuly.

-Who? Who are you designing for?  Who is going to use this website(product)?
Your Grandma? Your friends? Researchers? The general public (designing for one
is hard enough)?

-What? What are you making exactly?  Kind of lines up with who you're
making it for. Online recipie database? City laws and ordinences? 
A list of laws for your friend's reference and for government officials
will end up looking quite different.

-Why? Is this for an event? Personal project?

-When? Short term(holiday, event)? Long term(campaign, 

-How? How are you going to implement it? Once you get to this
question, you should be in a great position to move on. Making a mobile
version? This should be crossing into the planning and design phases.

(2) Planning kind of segue-s nicely from the How? stage of information
gathering. It would be impossible to plan without knowing who, what, why,
when, or how you're planning for. This is where you imagine and draw out
what your site might actually look like.  Flow charts, webs, and diagrams
are, probably, absolutely necessary.

(3) Design your site. Using wireframes (tools you can find online) you can
pretty much create your website, or rather, how it could look. Decide on
colors and fonts, layouts and formatting, images and text, etc.

(4) Development. This is the fun part where you write HTML and CSS code to
actually make your site look like your wireframe. 

(5) Testing and Delivery. This is the other fun part where you get to 
make sure all your code works. Make sure links work, images load, fonts,
colors, etc.  Make any changes and release it to your audience.

(6) Maintenance. Make sure your website keeps working.  Not only that,
but you might need to add features later, or remove them. You've rinsed,
lathered, and this is where you repeat. Listen to feedback and keep trying
to improve the site. Make something beautiful, even more so.

What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?

The primary goal is getting information about me to anyone who want to know. My site will
have personal background information, professional information, biographic info, contact
info, and perhaps links to blogs, both personal(externally) and professional.

What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?

My target audience is only interested in knowing more about me. That's pretty much the
only function of the site. I would consider adding features to get more of a conversation
between my audience and the work I'm doing.

What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site?
Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? 
It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.

They should mostly 'click' and view the content I have. There shouldn't be an overwhelming
amount on any given page that they have to 'search' for it. I plan that it would be 
intuitive enough to get to just by clicking through. My portfolio will be the main focus
and be given emphasis.

What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?

Design is everything! I come from an art background and a science background. You could
be the smartest at anything and everything, but if you're not nice, no one will listen or
care. If your site is functionally the best but your design is poor, no one will take 
your website or the content you put on it seriously.

What is user experience design and why is it valuable? 

Let's come back to our culture of chef vs customer. Developers use to design soley
for what they thought was best. They were still in customer mode and felt entitled
to it regardless of what their audience thought. But, if we think about it like we're
chefs: we make something we think is great, but our customer doesn't like it. If we
ignore our customer, we lose them to our competitors, but if we listen, we can modify
and grow our idea of what is good for our users.

Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?

Coming from an art background it was tedious to trod through all this design stuff.
But is was a good refresher and is good to relearn along with all the tech stuff we're
learning.
