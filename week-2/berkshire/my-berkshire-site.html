<!--
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?

It was interesting.  Much more interesting than creating wireframes, personally.  I am use to doing design and theory kind of stuff, so it was nice to sit down and create content.

- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?

I definitely prefer to use semantic elements.  It makes our jobs easier, and those of future onlookers of our code.  It just makes more sense than having 20 divs everywhere.

- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)

It was something my partner struggled with, but I am all for the seperation of it.  It is better not to bog down your skeleton with extra stuff.  Make-up is worn on the skin, not the bones.  To me, it's inherently a different process and will remain as seperated as possible.

- What seems good and bad about HTML?

I mean, it's great that you can make websites and stuff.  Creating content for everyone to see.  It is lack luster though.  Just an HTML website is boring and hard to look at.  But that's where things like CSS and Javascript come in, to make it nice and shiny.  As a stand alone product, it's purely functional and without form.

- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?

Open and close tags for (nearly) everything.  If you can't remember the name, it's either exactly the name (table) or it's abbreviated (div)((for the most part at least)).
