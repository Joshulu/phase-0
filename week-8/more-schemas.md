One to one relationship because we mostly want to access the rent information,

but also, not every apartment will have a renter occupying it.

•What is a one-to-one database?

A one-to-one database is one that for one x value, you might have one y value.

A room might have 1 or more doors, but each door only connects one room to another.

One door cannot open to multiple rooms.

•When would you use a one-to-one database? (Think generally, not in terms of the example you created).

You would use a one-to-one database when the information may be empty/null.  

And otherwise, when the information in one table only relates to one other piece

of information.  

-

•What is a many-to-many database?

When many pieces of information link to many other pieces of information.

Many cars are made by many manufacturers.  There's a lot of information on both

sides.

•When would you use a many-to-many database? (Think generally, not in terms of the example you created). 

When you have a lot of information on both sides.  Here I would think in themes

Music, art, cars.  We have a lot of artists and a lot of music, a lot of art and

a lot of artists a lot of cars and a lot of manufacturers.

•What is confusing about database schemas? What makes sense?

So far, it doesn't make sense to me yet, that we have the join table there.

I get so we can see the relationship, but I don't understand what it's purpose is

beyond a visual connection.

Everything else makes sense so far though.  We're just making connections.

I think it may be more important to know where your connections are, as

opposed to what kind of connections these are.
