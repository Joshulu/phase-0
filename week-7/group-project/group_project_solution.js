As a user I want:
To be able to add together, a series of numbers.
  To have that series be any length and should be added together regarless of the series containing an odd or even amount of numbers
To be able to do a mean of a series of numbers.
  Again I want that series to be any length and odd or even amount of numbers in series
To be able to determine the median of a series of numbers.
  This should be easier for an odd numbered series.
  Since no median exists for an even numbered one, I want it to give me the mean of the two middle numbers.
