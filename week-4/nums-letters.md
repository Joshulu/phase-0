What is an integer? What is a float?

an integer is a whole number.  Negative or positive.  A float is basically any other number.  1 is an integer.  1.0 is a float.

What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?

float division is the mathematical version.  It gives you an exact decimal answer to your equation.  Integer division does not.  It rounds your decimal down.  Going with the example in the book, integer division is good for determining simple limits.  How many movies can you see with x dollars?  How many hot dogs can you buy?  It applies to more real world activities.  People don't really want to sell you half a hot dog or half a movie, so it doesn't matter if you could technically afford half.
